Title: Programming Assignment 1 TU857/1

Program Description:

This is a C Program to view and change users ATM PIN. The PIN is any 4-digit number. It is stored using an array.
The customerâ€™s default PIN has been initially assigned the number 1234. This is a menu-driven program and will display a simple 
menu when run. The menu will display 4 options when run and the user selects their option by inputting that number. The user 
can input and verify their pin by inputting 1. They can change their pin by inputting 2. They can view how many times they 
inputted their PIN correct and incorrect by inputting 3. They can end the program smoothly by inputting 4 and confirming by inputting y/Y.
